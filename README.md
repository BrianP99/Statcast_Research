# Statcast_Research

This project was part of my coursework for SOC 225: Data and Society at the University of Washington. I utilized both Statcast Search and a CSV dataset obtained from "baseballsavant.mlb.com" to formulate my own research question, which I analyzed and visualized using several libraries in R Studio.
